                    <h2>Super Mario 64</h2>
                    <h3>
                        Super Mario 64 is a groundbreaking video game that revolutionized 3D platformers when it was released for the Nintendo 64. Players control Mario as he explores the vast, open world of Princess Peach’s castle, jumping between different vibrant levels to collect Power Stars. What I love about *Super Mario 64* is the freedom it offers, with each level filled with creative challenges and secrets to discover. The game's controls, although a bit dated by today's standards, were incredibly innovative at the time, and the charming, colorful design still holds up. The sense of adventure and joy from jumping around, solving puzzles, and defeating bosses makes it an unforgettable classic.

                    <h3>
                        Sonic the Hedgehog 3, released in 1994 for the Sega Genesis, is often considered the best game in the *Sonic* franchise for its perfect blend of fast-paced gameplay, level design, and memorable music. The game introduces new power-ups, two-player co-op gameplay, and a wide range of unique levels that push the series' iconic speed and platforming to new heights. What makes it stand out is its seamless integration of story, mechanics, and variety, creating an experience that’s both challenging and fun. The addition of Knuckles as a playable character and the fantastic music by Michael Jackson and the team adds even more depth and style. Sonic 3 balances everything that fans love about Sonic while refining the formula, making it the pinnacle of the series.

                    <h3>
                        Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, released in 1997 for the Nintendo 64 and PC, is a groundbreaking first-person shooter that combines action with prehistoric creatures and lush, vibrant environments. Players take on the role of Turok, a native warrior on a mission to stop an evil alien force while battling deadly dinosaurs. What I love about Turok is its unique blend of weapons, thrilling dino encounters, and exploration, creating an unforgettable experience that set it apart from other shooters of the time.

                    <h3>
                        Jet Grind Radio, released in 2000 for the Sega Dreamcast, is a vibrant and unique game that blends graffiti, urban skating, and a killer soundtrack into an unforgettable experience. Players control a group of rebellious skaters as they spray paint graffiti across a futuristic Tokyo while evading the police and rival gangs.
